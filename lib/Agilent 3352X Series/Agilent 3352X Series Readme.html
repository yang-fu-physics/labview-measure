	<h4>3. Known Issues</h4>
	<para>
		In driver revision prior to 1.2.3 it was reported a Timeout error would occur in Default Instrument Setup.vi on the "VISA enable event" with the model 33509.
		The workaround was removing the "VISA enable event".<br> This note was added since NI nor Keysight was able to reproduce this issue with current firmware.<br><br>
